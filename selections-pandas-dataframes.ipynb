    "## Selections From Pandas Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lesson introducing `pandas dataframes`, you learned that these data structures have an inherent tabular structure (i.e. rows and columns with header names) that support selecting data with indexing, such as selecting individual cells identified by their location at the intersection of rows and columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also select data from `pandas dataframes` without knowing the location of that data within the `pandas dataframe`, using specific values such as a column name or data value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will review how indexing works for `pandas dataframes` and you will learn how to select data from `pandas dataframes` using specific values as well as indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexing For Pandas Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of indexing in `pandas dataframes`: location-based and label-based. \n",
    "\n",
    "After working with indexing for `Python` lists and `numpy arrays`, you are familiar with location-based indexing. \n",
    "\n",
    "You already know that `Python` location-based indexing begins with `[0]`, and you have learned how to use location-based indexing to query data within `Python` lists or `numpy arrays`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use location-based indexing to query `pandas dataframes` using `.iloc` and providing the row and column selection as ranges (i.e. start and stop locations along the rows and columns). \n",
    "\n",
    "The range provided is inclusive of the first value, but not the second value. This means that you need to use the range `[0:1]` to select the first index, so your selection begins at `[0]` but does not include `[1]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can select the first row and the first column of a `pandas dataframes` providing the range `[0:1]` for the row selection and then providing the range `[0:1]` for the column selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataframe.iloc[0:1, 0:1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In addition to location-based indexing, `pandas dataframes` can also be queried using label-based indexing. This feature of `pandas dataframes` is very useful because you can create an index for `pandas dataframes` based on a list of values that you want to use for organizing and querying your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can create an index from a specific column of values, and then use `.loc` to select data from the `pandas dataframes` using a value that is found in that index. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "dataframe.setindex(\"column\")\n",
    "dataframe.loc[\"value\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this lesson, you will use both location and label indexing to select data from `pandas dataframes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Begin Writing Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you are familiar with importing the necessary `Python` packages to set your working directory and download the needed datasets using the `os` and `urllib` packages. You also need to import the `pandas` package with the alias `pd`.\n",

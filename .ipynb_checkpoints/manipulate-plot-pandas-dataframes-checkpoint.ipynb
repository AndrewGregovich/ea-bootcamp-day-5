    "## Methods and Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "Previous lessons have introduced the concept of functions as commands that can take inputs that are used to produce output. For example, you have used many functions, including the `print()` function to display the results of your code and to write messages about the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Message as text string goes here\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "You have also used functions provided by `Python` packages such as `numpy` to run calculations on `numpy arrays`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you used `np.mean()` to calculate the average value of specified `numpy array`. In these `numpy` functions, you explicitly provided the name of the variable as an input parameter.    \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Mean Value: \", np.mean(arrayname))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Python`, data structures, such as `pandas dataframes`, can provide built-in functions that are referred to as methods. Each data structure has its own set of methods, based on how the data is organized and the types of operations supported by the data structure . \n",
    "\n",
    "A method can be called by adding the `.function()` after the name of the data structure (e.g. `structurename.function()`), rather than providing the name as an input parameter (e.g. `function(structurename)`). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will explore some methods that are provided with the `pandas dataframe` data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to functions, you have also unknowingly worked with attributes, which are automatically created characteristics (i.e. metadata) about the data structure or object that you are working with. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you used `.shape` to get the dimensions of a specific `numpy array` (e.g. `arrayname.shape`), which is an attribute that is automatically generated about the `numpy array` when it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will use attributes to get more information about `pandas dataframes` and run functions (i.e. methods) inherent to the `pandas dataframes` data structure to learn about the benefits of working with `pandas dataframes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Begin Writing Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "From previous lessons, you know how to import the necessary `Python` packages to set your working directory and download the needed datasets using the `os` and `urllib` packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "To work with `pandas dataframes`, you will also need to import the `pandas` package with the alias `pd`, and you will need to import the `matplotlib.pyplot` module with the alias `plt` to plot data. Begin by reviewing these tasks.\n",

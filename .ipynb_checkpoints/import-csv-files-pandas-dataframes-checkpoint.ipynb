    "## Pandas Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lesson introducing `pandas dataframes`, you learned that these data structures that are inherently tabular, meaning that all values (or cells) have a row index and a column index, even if the data only has one row and/or one column. \n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned that unlike `numpy arrays`, `pandas dataframes` are two-dimensional by default and are composed of rows and columns. Each column in a `pandas dataframe` can have a labeled name (i.e. header name) and can contain a different type of data from its neighboring columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned that due to its inherent tabular structure, you can query and run calculations on `pandas dataframes` across an entire row, an entire column, or a specific cell or series of cells based on either location and attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn how to import tabular data from text files (.csv) into `pandas dataframes`, so you can take advantage of the benefits of working with `pandas dataframes`. \n",

    "## CSV Files For Tabular Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will work with tabular data that orignate from comma delimited (.csv), or CSV files. As you learned in the lessons on `numpy arrays`, CSV files are a very common file format used to collect and organize scientific data.   \n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned that unlike plain-text files which simply list out the values on separate lines without any symbols or delimiters, CSV files use commas (or some other delimiter like tab spaces or semi-colons) to indicate separate values. \n",
    "\n",
    "CSV files also support labeled names for the columns, referred to as headers. This means that CSV files can easily support multiple columns of related data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, these columns are data do not all have to be of the same type (i.e. all numeric or text strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, data for the average monthly precipitation data for Boulder, CO and the month names can actually be stored together in a comma delimited (.csv) file.\n",
    "\n",
